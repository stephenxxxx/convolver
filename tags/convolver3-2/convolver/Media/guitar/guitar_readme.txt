Acoustic Guitar Impulses
Ralph Gonzalez
17-March-2005

These are impulses from the body of a 3/4 size acoustic guitar,
a Taylor Baby. This is a small spruce-top guitar with a bright
tone. I made the impulse by applying a sharp "tap" to the bridge
using a ceramic spoon.

Don't apply this impulse to a complete mix! Probably the best
use is to convolve it against electric guitar, and mix this
with the "dry" guitar to approximate the sound of an 
acoustic. Note that much of the sound of an acoustic
guitar comes from the strings directly, so some "dry" signal
should be mixed in. One suggestion is to mic your electric 
guitar and mix this string noise in for added brightness.

Recording notes:

These are stereo 24-bit 44.1 kHz .wav files. Recorded with
a Studio Projects B1 and B3 (in cardioid setting), about 6"
apart and angled 30 degrees out. The "close" recording was
about 5" from the guitar and the "far" recording was about
14" away.

The preamp was an M-Audio DMP3 and A/D converter was an M-Audio
Audiophile 192 card.
